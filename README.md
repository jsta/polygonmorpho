sfpolymorph
===========

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The goal of sfpolymorph is to create an add-on for the `sf` package to quantify various aspects of polygon shape.

Roadmap
-------

-   Build off the work in <https://github.com/USEPA/lakemorpho> but use the sf package.

-   Incorporate additional metrics from <http://clear.uconn.edu/tools/Shape_Metrics/>
